    "First we start by creating a datahandler made to get tables from the catalogues in question. We crossmatch the literature with the crossmatch table by Hunt & Reffert (2023). We then see if any of those crossmatched clusters occur in the original literature data. The clusters in the literature can be in one of two states which yields respective data tables:\n",

This will help us understand the key features that differentiate these two groups and potentially uncover any biases or discrepancies between them.\n",
