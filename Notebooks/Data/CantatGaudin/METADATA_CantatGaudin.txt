Abstract:
    Many of the open clusters listed in modern catalogues were first
    reported by visual astronomers as apparent over-densities of bright
    stars. As observational techniques and analysis methods improved, some
    of them have been shown to be chance alignments of stars and are not
    true clusters. Recent publications making use of Gaia DR2 data
    provided membership list for over a thousand clusters, but many nearby
    objects listed in the literature have so far evaded detection. We
    update the Gaia DR2 cluster census by performing membership
    determinations for known clusters that had been missed by previous
    studies, and for recently discovered clusters. We investigate a subset
    of non-detected clusters that according to their literature parameters
    should be easily visible in the Gaia . Confirming or disproving the
    existence of old, inner-disc, high-altitude clusters is especially
    important as their survival or disruption is linked to the dynamical
    processes that drive the evolution of the Milky Way. We employ the
    Gaia DR2 catalogue and a membership assignment procedure, as well as
    visual inspection of spatial, proper motion, and parallax
    distributions. We use membership lists provided by other authors when
    they are available. We derive membership lists for 150 objects,
    including 10 that were known prior to Gaia . We compile a final list
    of members for 1481 clusters. Among the objects that we are still
    unable to identify with Gaia data, we argue that many (mostly putative
    old, relatively nearby, high-altitude objects) are not true clusters.
    At present, the only confirmed cluster located further than 500pc
    away from the Galactic plane within the Solar circle is NGC 6791. It
    is likely that the objects discussed in this study only represent a
    fraction of the non-physical groupings erroneously listed in the
    catalogues as genuine open clusters, and that those lists need further
    cleaning.

Description:
    The catalogue ibcluses lists of cluster members for objects that were
    not included in Cantat-Gaudin et al. (2018, Cat. J/A+A/618/A93) either
    because they were not identified or because they had not yet been
    discovered. We bring the total number of clusters with available
    membership from Gaia DR2 to 1481.

    table1:
    Mean parameters of the identified clusters.

    members:
    All columns from the Gaia DR2 catalogue, except the membership
    probability which was computed with the unsupervised classification
    scheme UPMASK applied to the Gaia DR2 proper motions and parallaxes.
